\# 🔔 Automatic Period Bell System



This project is a microcontroller-based automatic bell system designed for schools, colleges, and industries. It replaces the manual bell-ringing process with a programmable and accurate time-based bell system.



\## 🛠️ Features

\- Automatically rings bells based on predefined period timings.

\- Manual override via keypad buttons.

\- Real-time control with minimal human intervention.

\- Designed using ATmega328P microcontroller (Arduino-compatible).

\- Works on 6V relay output suitable for buzzers or external bells.
